# TSF_TASK-1_Data_Science_and_Business_Analytics

I have completed my Task #1 as Data Science and Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation. The task was to predict the score of students using simple linear regression model. Also, Simple linear regression gave the accuracy of 95% and only 5% of the error remain unexplained.
